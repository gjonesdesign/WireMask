# WireMask
This program uses clmtrackr to track various vertices on a face and obtain the x y values of facial features. Using the x y values of these vertices, the program draws a line from one random vertex to another random vertex. This creates a mask similar to a wireframe of a face. This process is also repeated with the eyes and mouth in a different color. 

## INSTRUCTIONS  
Simply run the code and look towards the camera. It will pick up your face and apply the mask to it. It may sometimes lose tracking or not track with 100% accuracy, this is just a limitation of the software.

## DEMO
A video of the mask being demoed can be found here:

## INITIAL CONCEPTS
This project originally was focused on creating a mask that used seperate peices of the webcam input to either distort, duplicate, or censor parts of the face. These early concepts looked as such:
